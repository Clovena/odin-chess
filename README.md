# odin-chess
Final project in The Odin Project curriculum: a CLI chess game.

Scratch notes:

- All coordinates are written as though on a board where [1, 1] is the bottom-left-most square. That is, all indexing and piece placing begins at 1, not 0; furthermore, indexing goes up to 8, not 7. 
  - This is implemented throughout the repo to improve legibility and decrease confusion for chess players used to a1 being the bottom-left-most square. The mental translation of a1 to [1, 1] is much easier than a1 to [0, 0].
